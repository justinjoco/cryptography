# Cryptography

My implementations of different cryptographic algorithms.


## Prerequisites

Requires BitVector module

```
pip install BitVector
```

## Notes
* All implementations can be run in Python 2.7, as this was what these assignments were designed to run on. Unfortunately, only AES and RSA so far can be run in Python 3+.

## Acknowledgments

* Thank you to Avi Kak from Purdue University for creating the BitVector module and providing some foundational functions that helped with the implementation of these algorithms.
